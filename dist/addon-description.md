Addon allows to schedule specific time slot and set reminders directly from a task page - an event will be created in Google Calendar automatically with "[Wrike]" prefix.

You can change scheduled event both in Wrike and in Google Calendar.

You can choose the calendar to use, set reminders via SMS or email.

You can quickly jump from Wrike task to event in calendar and back - addon adds links both to Wrike and to Google Calendar.
 
Typical use cases:

* Planning your own time or team collaboration
